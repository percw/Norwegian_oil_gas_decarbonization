# Geospatial Data for Oil and Gas Fields on the Norwegian Continental Shelf

## Overview

This repository contains data and analysis related to the oil and gas fields on the Norwegian Continental Shelf. The goal of this project is to analyze, manipulate, and visualize geospatial data for these fields using Python and various geospatial libraries. The aim of this project is to find the key drivers of the differences in carbon intensity between fields. These drivers will be used to optimize different decarbonization strategies for the fields.
