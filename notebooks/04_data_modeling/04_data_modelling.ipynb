    "### Introduction to Double Machine Learning (DML) Regression\n",
    "\n",
    "The Double Machine Learning (DML) regression framework aims to accurately estimate the causal effects of production levels and the quantity left in the field on pollution levels, while effectively accounting for other confounding factors that could influence these relationships. At its core, the model decomposes the relationship into two primary stages. In the first stage, advanced machine learning algorithms are utilized to predict the treatment variables (production level and quantity left in the field) based on a set of control variables. This step helps isolate the variation in the treatment variables that is not explained by the control variables. By doing so, it creates residuals—essentially, the unexplained parts of the treatment variables that are free from the confounding influence of the controls. In the second stage, these residuals are used in a regression model to predict the outcome variable (pollution), along with their interaction terms and squared terms to capture potential nonlinear effects and interactions. This approach ensures that the estimated effects of the treatment variables on pollution are unbiased and more reliable, as it rigorously controls for the confounding influence of other variables. The ultimate goal is to provide a clearer understanding of how changes in production and field practices directly impact pollution, free from the distortions caused by other factors.\n"
